## Project Description
I plan on making a basic version of chess. It will be built for pvp and will not have logic for a computer opponent.

## Game Logic

### Setup:
- An 8x8 square grid with alternating color scheme (Both in row and in coloumn) should be shown.
- The top 2 and bottom two rows should have the pieces in them when the game starts.
- Pieces with white on the bottom (1) and black on the top (8):
row 1 & 8: rook, knight, bishop, queen, king, bishop, knight, rook
row 2 & 7: all pawns

### logic
- The player should be able to move any of their pieces on a virtual chess board according to the rules of chess.

    - Example movement (pawn):
        - Can move one or two spaces forward if it has not been moved.
        - Otherwise it can only move one space forward.
        - Can't move over or into a space that is taken up by a piece of the same color.
        - Can't take an opposing piece unless it is one diagonal space away in front of the pawn.
        - If the pawn reaches the last row it becomes a queen.

- Players should be able to take opposing pieces based on the rules of chess.  

    - Example: Pawn can only take a piece if it is one diagonal space away and in front of the pawn.

- White should move first and then turns will alternate.
- Have a submit button or similar concept to end each player's turn.
- If a king is in check (can be taken), only moves that remove the check can be taken.
-Game over when a king is in checkmate
- There should be a reset button to return pieces to their starting position.

## Deliverables

### MVP Criteria
- A chess board with the proper setup (See game logic) should show at the start. (done)
- Players can move each piece according to the rules of chess. (can move freely atm)
- Pieces should be removed from the board when a piece takes them.
- Game ends if a player's king is in taken.

### Post-MVP Plans
- Have some way to track turns and not just have both sides able to move at the same time.
- Have an animation of the board turning between turns.
- If a player's king is in check only moves that remove check should be made.
- Reset button that resets the pieces to their starting positions.

### Stretch: 
- Quality of life improvements: such as highlighting where a piece can be moved etc.

### Something I don't know how to do yet: 
- animations
- Turn timers
